# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this election audit analysis was to become more familiar with the dispersion of voter features in the election_results csv through looping and conditional statements utilizing Python. We determine the number of votes per county as well as the votes per candidate and each respective percentage relative to the entire vote pool as a whole. We also find the largest county and the winner of the election.

## Election Audit Results
* The grand total of votes cast in this congressional election numbers 369,711.
* County Votes:
  * Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
  * Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
  * Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
* Denver has a crushing 82.8 % of the 3 counties present making it easily the highest contributor for the election.
* Candidate Votes: 
  *Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
  *Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
  *Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
* Diana Degette was the winner by far with 73.8% (272,892) of the total votes.

## Election Audit Summary
The election commission should consider further use of this script as it can easily be used for any other election with relatively little change. For instance, one would only need to change value names and specify new columns to iterate through for a similar result.
